## Building Blocks React Native Mobile -  Upvotedownvote

Building Blocks - React Native Master App - Upvotedownvote

Implement the [front end of Upvote/Downvote:](https://tracker.builder.ai/#/projects/1750?storyId=842880)

* As a user I can upvote or downvote a post and it will change color and show my selection in red.
* As a user if I have already liked the post and then I click on Like again, the like will change back to white. That means I have neither liked nor disliked that post. (Reverting your choice)
* As a user if I have already liked a post and then I dislike it, the counter of Like goes down by 1 and Dislike goes up by 1 and vice versa.
* As a user I see a post with Like button and Dislike button and a counter which shows number of likes or dislikes.
